# Advertising ROI Analysis Portfolio

Junior AI/ML Engineer in training — building real-world data science projects with Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Advertising Spend vs Sales Analysis

**Project Goal**: Analyze how different advertising channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper) perform in terms of sales generated per dollar spent.

**Dataset**: Classic Advertising dataset (Kaggle) — ad spend and sales for 200 campaigns.

**Key Insights**:
- **Radio** delivers the highest return: ~1.39 sales units per $1 spent
- **Newspaper** close behind: ~1.32 sales units per $1
- **TV** is least efficient per dollar: ~0.17 sales units per $1 (despite highest total spend)

This suggests reallocating budget toward Radio could maximize sales efficiency.

**Files**:
- `advertising.csv` — raw data
- `advertising_roi_analysis.py` — main analysis code (Pandas + Matplotlib)
- `sales_per_dollar.png` — bar chart visualization

**Skills Demonstrated**:
- Data loading and cleaning with Pandas
- Feature engineering (sales per dollar calculation)
- Grouped aggregation and summary statistics
- Professional data visualization with Matplotlib
- Insight extraction from real marketing data

**Next Projects**:
- Customer churn modeling
- RAG Chatbox
